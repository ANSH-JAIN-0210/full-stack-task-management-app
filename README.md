# Project Name

## Overview

This project is a web application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It allows users to perform various actions (e.g., browsing items, adding to cart, etc.). This README will guide you through setting up the project locally and running the development server.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server, and your app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

## Additional Notes

- To build the project for production, use the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
